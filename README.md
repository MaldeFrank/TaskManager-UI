# CleanApp-UI
Frontend for taskmanager application.


## Bugs

  
## Future development
- Options should be added to change how long an assignment is visible.
- Each assignment tab should have the names of each Google account that can be seen, so there is an overview of who the list is shared with.
- When a task is completed, the points should be allocated to the assigned user.

## Future features
- Schema: A schema should be added, which is a list you can add tasks to, so you dont have to take each task each week onto a list, but can just choose a schema with the tasks you want.
- Automatic adding of tasks/schema: Schema and tasks should have a feature to be added automatically each week, month or whatever.
