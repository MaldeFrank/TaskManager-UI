# CleanApp-UI
Frontend for clean application.


## Bugs
- When two non google users are created, you they act as one in assign dropdown.
- When you try to add an email that is has not signed in before, it gives 500 error.
  
## Future development
- Mine opgaver tab does not auto render when a new assignment has been created.
- User should be able to change tab names.
- Options should be added to change how long an assignment is visible.
- Each assignment tab should have the names of each Google account that can be seen, so there is an overview of who the list is shared with.
- When a task is completed, the points should be allocated to the assigned user.

## Future features
- Schema: A schema should be added, which is a list you can add tasks to, so you dont have to take each task each week onto a list, but can just choose a schema with the tasks you want.
- Automatic adding of tasks/schema: Schema and tasks should have a feature to be added automatically each week, month or whatever.

## Changes
- Name of opgave liste has to be changed.
